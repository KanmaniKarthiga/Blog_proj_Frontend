Using the canvas of a love story, director Sameer Vidwans addresses an important issue that has plagued our society for long, and in the process, he blends raw emotions of the young generation, conservative outlook of the elderly, and the shame that middle-class lot has for long lived with. With a brilliant story and idea in hand, the film falters at places with its execution, though it's never to an extent that it takes away from the purity of the story. A musical romance with a good-looking lead pair -- Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani -- who have earlier also made heads turn with their chemistry in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 - Satyaprem Ki Katha is refreshing, entertaining but never lets go of the sensitivity of the subject at hand.",

Adding a dash of turmeric to tea blends or detox water or soups can help in naturally healing the inflammation in the body caused due to excessive Triglyceride levels in the body.

            content:"Start with the fact that water workouts are low-impact, meaning that they’re easy on your muscles and joints. Per a research review published in ACSM’s Health and Fitness Journal in 2019, that means water exercise allows you to work out at higher intensities and longer duration with lower risk of injury compared to land-based workouts.By putting less stress on your body, low-impact workouts require fewer rest days and reduce the chances of injury, adds Angela Ruest, NASM-certified personal trainer and water aerobics instructor at Life Time Westminster in Westminster, Colorado. This means moving your activity to the water can be a good way to rehab from an injury, too — although make sure you get a doctor’s clearance first.",

            content:"Cool tech, but IMO this is long-term useless for many areas. In a lot of the West, including California, the problem is that there is a buildup of fuel that, due to the dry climate, doesn't really rot. Eventually this fuel has to burn. We've kept increasing the technology applied to suppression, first with fire engines, then hotshot crews, aerial firefighting, then satellites that can detect fires, and now automated cameras. Each innovation makes the response quicker and more effective, so more and more fuel can build up before it finally burns.I liken this to damming up a river with no outlet for the water. The water keeps accumulating, so you build the dam higher every year. After a while, the dam is so high that concrete isn't strong enough so you build it higher with carbon fiber. Then that's not strong enough so you start using carbon nanotubes. The end result is that you have this massively unstable system that is going to eventually catastrophically fail.",
